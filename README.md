This is a demonstration of how we can know if the device has reached in 1 km of its destination in the most simple way.

How it works:
Press the start button and choose your desired location from the map.
There is a possibility to search a location if its not visible on current map.
A service will start running on the background and as soon as user reaches within 1 km, they receive a message.
Service stops after sending the info.
If user wants to start again they can choose another destination and the process goes on.
